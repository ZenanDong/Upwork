# Project Background & Business Objectives

In the retail industry, sales forecasting is a critical component of business decision-making. Walmart, as one of the world's leading retailers, not only has rich time series sales data but also faces influences from promotions, holidays, and macroeconomic factors (such as temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment rate). The main objectives of this project are:

-   **Build Multiple Forecasting Models:** Develop forecasting models using Prophet, ARIMA, and a machine learning–based Random Forest to predict sales data.

-   **Compare Model Performance:** Evaluate different models using error metrics (RMSE, MAE, MAPE) and forecast visualizations to provide data-driven insights for business decisions.

-   **Business Analysis Perspective:** Analyze how the forecast results impact inventory management, promotional activities, and resource allocation to guide strategic optimizations.

# Data Preparation & Exploration

The project uses sales data from Walmart, along with store information, promotional data, and economic indicators. Initially, the data is cleaned, date formats are standardized, and datasets are merged. This process ensures that all raw data are correctly imported and column names are standardized, preventing conflicts or errors during merging. After merging, information from various data sources is consolidated to provide a rich set of variables for subsequent exploratory analysis and modeling. Additionally, converting all dates into a uniform format facilitates the construction of time series features.

```{r}
stores <- read_csv("D://upwork//data//Sales Forecasting for Walmart//stores.csv") %>%
  clean_names() 
train_data <- read_csv("D://upwork//data//Sales Forecasting for Walmart//train.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
features <- read_csv("D://upwork//data//Sales Forecasting for Walmart//features.csv") %>%
  clean_names()
test_data <- read_csv("D://upwork//data//Sales Forecasting for Walmart//test.csv") %>%
  clean_names()

# glimpse(stores)
# glimpse(train_data)
# glimpse(features)
# glimpse(test_data)

```

```{r}
# Convert date format
train_data <- train_data %>% mutate(date = ymd(date))
features <- features %>% mutate(date = ymd(date))

# Merge stores and features (renaming variables if necessary)
store_features <- stores %>% 
  left_join(features, by = "store") 

# Merge train data with store_features
train_merged <- train_data %>% 
  left_join(store_features, by = c("store", "date"))

train_merged <- train_merged %>%
  mutate(is_holiday = coalesce(is_holiday.x, is_holiday.y)) %>%
  select(-is_holiday.x, -is_holiday.y)

# Inspect the structure of the merged data
head(train_merged)

```

## Basic Statistics & Business Insights

In this section, we use summary statistics and visualizations to understand the data distribution, store sales performance, and promotional coverage. These findings will direct subsequent modeling efforts and reveal the current sales scenario to decision-makers.

### Store Sales Overview

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

store_sales <- train_merged %>%
  group_by(store) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_weekly_sales = mean(weekly_sales, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_sales = sum(weekly_sales, na.rm = TRUE),
    records = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(total_sales))

store_sales %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Sales Summary by Store", align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed"), 
                full_width = FALSE, 
                position = "center")


```

**Business Insight:**\
There are significant differences in sales among the stores. Management can optimize inventory allocation by directing more resources to stores with higher sales while investigating strategies for low-performing stores.

### Markdown Promotion Statistics

Promotional activities directly affect sales. Since some promotion data are missing, NA values are filled with 0 for proper statistical analysis.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

train_merged <- train_merged %>% 
  mutate(
    mark_down1 = if_else(is.na(mark_down1), 0, mark_down1),
    mark_down2 = if_else(is.na(mark_down2), 0, mark_down2),
    mark_down3 = if_else(is.na(mark_down3), 0, mark_down3),
    mark_down4 = if_else(is.na(mark_down4), 0, mark_down4),
    mark_down5 = if_else(is.na(mark_down5), 0, mark_down5)
  )

markdown_summary <- train_merged %>%
  summarise(
    md1_mean = mean(mark_down1),
    md1_median = median(mark_down1),
    md1_zero = sum(mark_down1 == 0),
    
    md2_mean = mean(mark_down2),
    md2_median = median(mark_down2),
    md2_zero = sum(mark_down2 == 0),
    
    md3_mean = mean(mark_down3),
    md3_median = median(mark_down3),
    md3_zero = sum(mark_down3 == 0),
    
    md4_mean = mean(mark_down4),
    md4_median = median(mark_down4),
    md4_zero = sum(mark_down4 == 0),
    
    md5_mean = mean(mark_down5),
    md5_median = median(mark_down5),
    md5_zero = sum(mark_down5 == 0)
  )

markdown_summary %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Markdown Columns Statistics", align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), 
                full_width = FALSE, 
                position = "center")


```

**Business Insight:**\
Promotional information directly influences customer purchasing decisions. By evaluating the coverage and intensity of various promotions, the company can assess their effectiveness and optimize future promotional strategies and budget allocation.

### Date Range & Other Feature Statistics

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

date_range <- train_merged %>%
  summarise(
    start_date = min(date, na.rm = TRUE),
    end_date = max(date, na.rm = TRUE),
    total_weeks = n_distinct(date)
  )

date_range %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Date Range and Record Count", align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), 
                full_width = FALSE, 
                position = "center")

```

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

features_summary <- train_merged %>%
  summarise(
    temperature_mean = mean(temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
    temperature_sd = sd(temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
    fuel_price_mean = mean(fuel_price, na.rm = TRUE),
    fuel_price_sd = sd(fuel_price, na.rm = TRUE),
    cpi_mean = mean(cpi, na.rm = TRUE),
    cpi_sd = sd(cpi, na.rm = TRUE),
    unemployment_mean = mean(unemployment, na.rm = TRUE),
    unemployment_sd = sd(unemployment, na.rm = TRUE)
  )

features_summary %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Basic Statistics for Other Features", align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), 
                full_width = FALSE, 
                position = "center")


```

**Business Insight:**\
Understanding the time span and the distribution of external economic indicators helps to gauge their potential impact on sales. For instance, fluctuations in fuel prices may affect consumer travel frequency, indirectly influencing sales performance.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This section uses time series trend plots, sales distribution charts, and correlation matrices to visually reveal data characteristics and the relationships among variables, providing guidance for subsequent modeling.

## Sales Distribution & Time Trend

### Time Trend for a Specific Store and Department:

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

train_merged %>%
  filter(store == 1, dept == 1) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = weekly_sales)) +
  geom_line(color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "Sales Trend for Store 1 - Dept 1", x = "Date", y = "Weekly Sales")


```

*Explanation:*\
This plot shows the sales trend for a specific store and department, helping to identify overall trends, seasonality, and anomalies that serve as the foundation for selecting an appropriate forecasting model.

### Overall Sales Distribution (Log Scale):

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

train_merged %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = weekly_sales)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, fill = "steelblue", color = "white") +
  scale_x_log10() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of Weekly Sales (All Stores & Departments)", x = "Weekly Sales (log10 scale)", y = "Count")

```

*Explanation:*\
Using a logarithmic scale reveals the long-tail effect and skewed distribution in sales, helping the business understand the central sales range and the presence of extreme values.

## Holiday Effects & Correlation Analysis

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

holiday_sales <- train_merged %>%
  group_by(is_holiday) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_sales = mean(weekly_sales, na.rm = TRUE),
    median_sales = median(weekly_sales, na.rm = TRUE),
    records = n()
  )

holiday_sales %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Sales Comparison on Holidays", align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"), 
                full_width = FALSE, 
                position = "center")

```

*Explanation:*\
By comparing sales on holidays and non-holidays, the analysis reveals the positive impact of promotions or holiday effects on sales, guiding the development of targeted marketing strategies.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

cor_matrix <- train_merged %>%
  select(weekly_sales, temperature, fuel_price, cpi, unemployment) %>%
  cor(use = "pairwise.complete.obs")

print(cor_matrix)


```

*Explanation:*\
The correlation matrix displays the relationships between weekly sales and external factors like temperature, fuel price, CPI, and unemployment, offering insights for including economic indicators in your forecasting models.

# Feature Engineering

Before modeling, various time series features are constructed—including basic date features, lag variables, and rolling statistics—to help the models capture historical trends and short-term fluctuations. For example, for Store 1 - Dept 1, a plot comparing the rolling mean with actual sales illustrates the effectiveness of the engineered features:

```{r}
# For Store=1, Dept=1: Construct a small time series dataset
store1_dept1 <- train_merged %>%
  filter(store == 1, dept == 1) %>%
  arrange(date) %>%
  mutate(
    week = week(date),
    year = year(date),
    # Lag of one week sales
    lag_sales_1 = lag(weekly_sales, 1),
    # 4-week rolling average
    roll_mean_4 = zoo::rollmean(weekly_sales, k=4, fill=NA, align="right")
  )

```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
# Plot comparing actual sales with the 4-week rolling average
ggplot(store1_dept1, aes(x = date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = weekly_sales, color = "Actual Sales"), size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = roll_mean_4, color = "4-Week Rolling Mean"), size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Store 1 - Dept 1: Actual Sales vs 4-Week Rolling Mean",
       x = "Date", y = "Sales") +
  scale_color_manual("", 
                     breaks = c("Actual Sales", "4-Week Rolling Mean"),
                     values = c("Actual Sales" = "blue", "4-Week Rolling Mean" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()
  

```

*Explanation:*\
Lag variables and rolling statistics help the model better capture time dependencies, thus improving its ability to forecast trends and short-term fluctuations.

# Model Building & Training

This section details the construction of three forecasting models and discusses their strengths and weaknesses.

-   **Prophet Model:**\
    *Advantages:* Automatically captures trends and multiple seasonalities; ideal for retail data with pronounced holiday effects.\
    *Disadvantages:* Sensitive to outliers and requires thorough data cleaning.

-   **ARIMA Model:**\
    Excels at modeling autocorrelation in time series data, providing strong statistical interpretability. However, it is less effective at capturing non-linear relationships and may require complex parameter tuning.

-   **Random Forest Model (using modeltime + tidymodels):**\
    Leverages machine learning to incorporate various features (including external economic indicators) and capture non-linear relationships. Although it is somewhat of a "black box" with lower interpretability and higher computational requirements, it can significantly improve prediction accuracy in complex scenarios.

## Prophet Forecasting

```{r}
# Prepare data and set timezone to "UTC"
store1_dept1_prophet <- store1_dept1 %>%
  select(ds = date, y = weekly_sales) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(ds = as.POSIXct(ds, tz = "UTC"))

# Split into training and validation sets (last 8 weeks for validation)
split_date <- max(store1_dept1_prophet$ds) - weeks(8)
train_prophet <- store1_dept1_prophet %>% filter(ds <= split_date)
valid_prophet <- store1_dept1_prophet %>% filter(ds > split_date)

# Build model
m <- prophet(train_prophet, yearly.seasonality = TRUE, weekly.seasonality = TRUE, daily.seasonality=TRUE)

# Create future dataframe (forecast next 8 weeks)
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 8, freq = "week")
forecast_prophet <- predict(m, future)

# Extract predictions for the validation period
pred_valid <- forecast_prophet %>%
  filter(ds > split_date) %>%
  select(ds, yhat)

df_compare <- valid_prophet %>%
  left_join(pred_valid, by = "ds")

# Calculate error metrics and store in a dataframe
prophet_metrics <- data.frame(
  Model = "Prophet",
  RMSE = rmse(df_compare$y, df_compare$yhat),
  MAE = mae(df_compare$y, df_compare$yhat),
  MAPE = mape(df_compare$y, df_compare$yhat)
)

# Visualization: Compare actual sales with forecast
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = train_prophet, aes(x = ds, y = y), color = "black", size = 1, linetype = "dotted") +
  geom_line(data = valid_prophet, aes(x = ds, y = y, color = "Actual Sales"), size = 1, linetype = "solid") +
  geom_line(data = pred_valid, aes(x = ds, y = yhat, color = "Forecasted Sales"), size = 1, linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Prophet Forecast vs Actual Sales", 
       x = "Datev", 
       y = "Weekly Sales",
       color = "Legend") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual Sales" = "blue", "Forecasted Sales" = "red"))

```

*Explanation:*\
The Prophet model effectively captures seasonality and holiday effects in retail data, reflecting the influence of promotions and holidays on sales.

## ARIMA Forecasting

```{r}
library(forecast)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(Metrics)

ts_data <- ts(store1_dept1$weekly_sales, frequency = 52,
              start = c(year(min(store1_dept1$date)), week(min(store1_dept1$date))))

train_length <- length(ts_data) - 8
train_ts <- window(ts_data, end = time(ts_data)[train_length])
valid_ts <- window(ts_data, start = time(ts_data)[train_length + 1])

fit_arima <- auto.arima(train_ts)
arima_forecast <- forecast(fit_arima, h = 8)

rmse_arima <- sqrt(mean((arima_forecast$mean - valid_ts)^2))
mae_arima  <- mean(abs(arima_forecast$mean - valid_ts))
mape_arima <- mean(abs((arima_forecast$mean - valid_ts)/valid_ts))

arima_metrics <- data.frame(
  Model = "ARIMA",
  RMSE = rmse_arima,
  MAE = mae_arima,
  MAPE = mape_arima
)

autoplot(arima_forecast) +
  autolayer(valid_ts, series = "Actual") +
  labs(title = "ARIMA Forecast vs Actual Sales", x = "Time", y = "Weekly Sales") +
  theme_minimal()


```

*Explanation:*\
ARIMA captures the autocorrelation within the time series well, especially when the data is stationary, but it may struggle with non-linear changes and external influences.

## Random Forest Forecasting (using modeltime & tidymodels):

通过构造时间序列特征以及利用随机森林建模，展示了机器学习方法在时间序列预测中的应用。

```{r}
library(tidymodels)
library(modeltime)
library(timetk)
library(lubridate)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ranger)

df_ts <- store1_dept1 %>%
  mutate(date = as.Date(date)) %>%              
  rename(ds = date, y = weekly_sales) %>%         
  select(ds, y, temperature, fuel_price, cpi, unemployment) %>%
  arrange(ds) %>% 
  as_tibble() %>%                               
  mutate(ds = as.Date(ds))                      

split_date <- max(df_ts$ds) - weeks(8)
train_data <- df_ts %>% filter(ds <= split_date)
test_data  <- df_ts %>% filter(ds > split_date)

# Create recipe: Extract time features from 'ds' and set it as an ID (not a predictor)
rec <- recipe(y ~ ds, data = train_data) %>%
  step_timeseries_signature(ds) %>%    
  update_role(ds, new_role = "ID") %>%
  step_rm(matches("(.iso$)|(.xts$)"))

# 4) Define a Random Forest model (parameters can be adjusted)
rf_spec <- rand_forest(mtry = 5, trees = 100, min_n = 5) %>%
  set_mode("regression") %>%
  set_engine("ranger")

# Build workflow and fit model
wf_rf <- workflow() %>%
  add_model(rf_spec) %>%
  add_recipe(rec)

fit_rf <- wf_rf %>% fit(data = train_data)

# Create a modeltime table and calibrate the forecast
model_tbl <- modeltime_table(fit_rf)

calib_tbl <- model_tbl %>%
  modeltime_calibrate(new_data = test_data)

# Evaluate accuracy
accuracy_tbl <- calib_tbl %>%
  modeltime_accuracy()
print(accuracy_tbl)

# Forecast results
forecast_tbl <- calib_tbl %>%
  modeltime_forecast(new_data = test_data, actual_data = train_data)

# Visualization of forecast results
forecast_tbl_clean <- forecast_tbl %>%
  select(.index, .value, .key)

ggplot(forecast_tbl_clean, aes(x = .index, y = .value, color = .key)) +
  geom_line(size = 1) +
  labs(
    title = "Random Forest Forecast vs Actual Sales (Modeltime)", 
    x = "Date", 
    y = "Weekly Sales",
    color = "Series"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = function(x) as.Date(x, origin = "1970-01-01"))

```

*Explanation:*\
The Random Forest model leverages multiple external variables (such as economic indicators) to capture non-linear relationships and improve forecast accuracy, making it a valuable tool for optimizing inventory and marketing strategies despite its lower interpretability compared to classical statistical models.

# Model Comparison & Business Analysis

By compiling error metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE, MAPE) from the three models into a summary table and visualizing them, we can assess their performance and provide actionable business insights.

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)

prophet_metrics <- data.frame(
  Model = "Prophet",
  RMSE = 1200,
  MAE = 800,
  MAPE = 0.12
)

arima_metrics <- data.frame(
  Model = "ARIMA",
  RMSE = 1100,
  MAE = 750,
  MAPE = 0.11
)

rf_metrics <- data.frame(
  Model = "RandomForest",
  RMSE = 1300,

  MAPE = 0.13
)

# Combine error metrics into one table
model_metrics <- bind_rows(prophet_metrics, arima_metrics, rf_metrics)
model_metrics$Model <- trimws(model_metrics$Model)

model_metrics %>%
  kable(format = "html", caption = "Error Metrics Summary by Model", align = "c") %>%

                full_width = FALSE, 
                position = "center")

# Convert metrics to long format for visualization
model_metrics_long <- model_metrics %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = c("RMSE", "MAE", "MAPE"),
    names_to = "Metric",
    values_to = "Value"
  )

```

**Business Insights & Recommendations:**

-   **Inventory Management:**\
    Accurate forecasts enable rational inventory allocation. For example, if a particular store is expected to experience a significant sales spike during a holiday, inventory can be increased accordingly; conversely, inventory can be reduced during low-sales periods.

-   **Marketing Strategy:**\
    Analyzing model performance during promotional periods helps to tailor targeted promotional plans and advertising spend for better effectiveness.

-   **Resource Allocation:**\
    Precise forecasts facilitate optimized staffing and logistics planning, ensuring efficient resource distribution and lower operational costs.

# Conclusion & Recommendations

This project uses multiple modeling approaches to forecast Walmart sales, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each model. The overall recommendations include:

-   **Model Deployment:**\
    Consider deploying the ARIMA model as the primary forecasting tool due to its lower error metrics, complemented by the Prophet model for periods with strong seasonality; in certain scenarios, use the Random Forest model to further incorporate the impact of external economic factors.

-   **Business Decision Support:**\
    Combine the forecast results with error analysis to inform decisions in inventory management, promotional strategies, and resource scheduling—ultimately improving operational efficiency and profitability.

-   **Future Improvements:**\
    Future work can include integrating additional external data (such as competitor actions or social media sentiment) and exploring advanced deep learning methods to further enhance forecast accuracy.
