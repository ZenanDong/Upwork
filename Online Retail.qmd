# **Data Preprocessing**

## **Dataset Overview**

The dataset includes the following transaction details:

-   **Invoice Number** – Unique identifier for each transaction.

-   **StockCode & Description** – Product ID and product name.

-   **Quantity & Price** – Number of items purchased and price per unit.

-   **InvoiceDate** – Timestamp of the transaction.

-   **Customer ID** – Unique identifier for each customer.

-   **Country** – The country of purchase.

## Data Cleaning

To ensure the **quality and reliability** of our analysis, we perform the following preprocessing steps:

✅ **Remove missing Customer IDs**

-   Transactions without customer IDs are discarded as they cannot be associated with specific customer behavior.

✅ **Filter out negative values**

-   Transactions with negative quantities or prices (likely due to refunds or errors) are removed.

✅ **Calculate total spending per transaction**

$$ Total Spend=Quantity×Price $$

✅ **Aggregate customer purchase behavior**

-   **Total Revenue per Customer:** Sum of all purchases per customer.

-   **Purchase Frequency:** Number of transactions per customer.

-   **Recency:** Days since the last purchase.

## **Data Cleaning Steps**

-   **Removed missing Customer IDs**: Transactions without customer IDs were discarded.

-   **Filtered out negative values**: Transactions with negative quantities or prices (likely returns) were removed.

-   **Computed total spending per transaction**: `Total_Spend = Quantity × Price`.

-   **Aggregated customer data**:

    -   **Total Revenue per Customer**: Sum of all purchases.

    -   **Purchase Frequency**: Number of transactions per customer.

    -   **Recency**: Days since the last purchase.

```{r}
# 数据清理
df_clean <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(`Customer ID`)) %>%
  filter(Quantity > 0, Price > 0) %>%
  mutate(Total_Spend = Quantity * Price)

# 计算 RFM 指标
customer_rfm <- df_clean %>%
  group_by(`Customer ID`) %>%
  summarise(
    Recency = as.numeric(difftime(max(InvoiceDate), Sys.Date(), units = "days")),
    Frequency = n(),
    Monetary = sum(Total_Spend)
  )
head(customer_rfm)
```

💡 **Insight**:\
These **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features** provide a structured way to **differentiate customer groups** based on their spending behavior.

# **Customer Segmentation Using Clustering**

## Step 1: Standardizing the Data

Since **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary** values have different scales, we **normalize the dataset** to ensure fair clustering.

```{r}
# 数据标准化
customer_rfm_scaled <- scale(customer_rfm[, -1])
```

## Step 2: Applying Clustering Algorithms

We explore three clustering techniques to segment customers effectively:

### **1️⃣ K-Means Clustering**

-   Groups customers into **3 segments** based on RFM scores.

-   Assigns each customer to the closest cluster centroid.

```{r}
# K-Means 聚类
set.seed(123)
kmeans_result <- kmeans(customer_rfm_scaled, centers = 3, nstart = 25)
customer_rfm$Cluster_KMeans <- as.factor(kmeans_result$cluster)
```

✅ **Findings**:

-   **Cluster 1:** High-value, frequent buyers.

-   **Cluster 2:** Occasional buyers with medium spending.

-   **Cluster 3:** Low-frequency, low-spending customers.

### **2️⃣ DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)**

-   Detects **natural groups of customers** based on purchase density.

-   Identifies **outliers (noise customers)** who don’t belong to any cluster.

```{r}
# DBSCAN 聚类
set.seed(123)
dbscan_result <- dbscan(customer_rfm_scaled, eps = 1, minPts = 5)
customer_rfm$Cluster_DBSCAN <- as.factor(dbscan_result$cluster)
```

✅ **Findings**:

-   **DBSCAN captures natural customer clusters** without needing to predefine K.

-   **Customers labeled as `-1` are outliers**, indicating irregular buying patterns.

### **3️⃣ Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**

-   Provides a **soft clustering approach**, meaning customers belong to multiple clusters with probabilities.

-   Suitable for **complex distributions** where hard assignments (like K-Means) don’t work well.

```{r}
# GMM 聚类
set.seed(123)
gmm_result <- Mclust(customer_rfm_scaled)
customer_rfm$Cluster_GMM <- as.factor(gmm_result$classification)
```

✅ **Findings**:

-   GMM **avoids hard boundaries** and **assigns probability scores** to each cluster.

-   Useful when customer behavior **overlaps between segments**.

```{r}
plot_cluster <- function(cluster_col) {
  ggplotly(
    ggplot(customer_rfm, aes_string(x = "Monetary", y = "Recency", color = cluster_col)) +
      geom_point() +
      labs(title = paste("Clustering Result -", cluster_col))
  )
}

plot_data <- list(
  "Cluster_KMeans" = plot_cluster("Cluster_KMeans")$x$data,
  "Cluster_DBSCAN" = plot_cluster("Cluster_DBSCAN")$x$data,
  "Cluster_GMM" = plot_cluster("Cluster_GMM")$x$data
)

htmltools::tagList(
  htmltools::tags$label("Select Clustering Method:"),
  htmltools::tags$select(id = "clusterDropdown",
    htmltools::tags$option(value = "Cluster_KMeans", "K-Means"),
    htmltools::tags$option(value = "Cluster_DBSCAN", "DBSCAN"),
    htmltools::tags$option(value = "Cluster_GMM", "GMM")
  ),
  htmlwidgets::onRender(
    plot_cluster("Cluster_KMeans"),
    sprintf(
      "function(el, x) {
        var plotData = %s;
        document.getElementById('clusterDropdown').addEventListener('change', function() {
          var selected = this.value;
          Plotly.react(el, plotData[selected]);
        });
      }",
      jsonlite::toJSON(plot_data, auto_unbox = TRUE)
    )
  )
)
```

## Step 3: Evaluating Cluster Performance

To measure clustering effectiveness, we compute **silhouette scores**:

```{r}
library(cluster)
sil_kmeans <- silhouette(kmeans_result$cluster, dist(customer_rfm_scaled))
sil_dbscan <- silhouette(dbscan_result$cluster, dist(customer_rfm_scaled))
sil_gmm <- silhouette(gmm_result$classification, dist(customer_rfm_scaled))

silhouette_scores <- data.frame(
  Method = c("K-Means", "DBSCAN", "GMM"),
  Score = c(mean(sil_kmeans[, 3]), mean(sil_dbscan[, 3]), mean(sil_gmm[, 3]))
)

p2 <- ggplot(silhouette_scores, aes(x = Method, y = Score, fill = Method)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(title = "Silhouette Score Comparison")

ggplotly(p2)
```

✅ **Findings**:

-   A **higher silhouette score** indicates **better-defined clusters**.

-   K-Means performs well, but **DBSCAN is more effective in identifying noise customers**.

# RFM Heatmap Analysis

The **RFM Heatmap** visually represents how **Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values** vary across different customer clusters identified by **K-Means clustering**.

```{r}
melted_rfm <- melt(customer_rfm[, c("Recency", "Frequency", "Monetary", "Cluster_KMeans")], id.vars = "Cluster_KMeans")

p3 <- ggplot(melted_rfm, aes(x = variable, y = Cluster_KMeans, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile() +
  labs(title = "RFM Heatmap by Cluster") +
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "blue", high = "red")

ggplotly(p3)
```

## **Interpretation of the Heatmap**

-   The **x-axis** represents the **RFM metrics** (**Recency, Frequency, and Monetary**).

-   The **y-axis** represents different **customer clusters** as identified by **K-Means**.

-   The **color gradient (from blue to red)** indicates **low to high values** for each RFM metric within each cluster.

## 💡 **Key Insights from the Heatmap:**

1.  **Monetary (M) & Frequency (F) are strongly correlated for high-value customers**

    -   The cluster with the **highest monetary spending (red color)** is also the one with **high frequency**, indicating loyal, high-spending customers.

2.  **Recency (R) is higher (blue) for inactive or lost customers**

    -   If a cluster shows a **high recency (blue color)**, it means those customers haven't purchased for a long time.

    -   These customers might need **win-back campaigns** (e.g., discounts, re-engagement emails).

3.  **Clusters with lower Frequency & Monetary have higher Recency**

    -   Occasional shoppers tend to have **lower transaction counts and spending**, while **frequent buyers** appear in clusters with **higher monetary and frequency values**.

## **Business Application**

✅ **High-value customers (Low Recency, High Frequency & Monetary):**

-   Target with **loyalty programs**, **VIP discounts**, and **exclusive offers**.\
    ✅ **Occasional buyers (Mid Recency, Mid Frequency & Monetary):**

-   Encourage **repeat purchases** with **personalized promotions** and **email campaigns**.\
    ✅ **Inactive customers (High Recency, Low Frequency & Monetary):**

-   Implement **win-back campaigns** with **discounts & reactivation offers**.

# Customer Retention & Churn Analysis

In addition to customer segmentation, it's crucial to analyze **customer churn**, i.e., whether certain customers stop purchasing or if their buying frequency decreases. By tracking customer retention trends, businesses can implement targeted marketing strategies to **reduce churn and increase repeat purchases**.

## Calculating Customer Churn Rate

### **Methodology:**

1.  **Calculate the total number of active customers per month** (customers who made at least one purchase in that month).

2.  **Identify repeat customers** (customers who made purchases in consecutive months).

3.  **Compute the churn rate** using the formula:

$$
Churn Rate=(1−Repeat Customers / Total Customers​)×100
$$

-   **Repeat Customers**: Customers who purchased both in the current month and the previous month.

-   **Total Customers**: The total number of unique customers in that month.

```{r}
library(lubridate)

churn_rate <- df_clean %>%
  mutate(InvoiceMonth = floor_date(InvoiceDate, "month")) %>%
  group_by(InvoiceMonth) %>%
  summarise(
    Total_Customers = n_distinct(`Customer ID`),
    Repeat_Customers = sum(duplicated(`Customer ID`))
  ) %>%
  mutate(Churn_Rate = (1 - Repeat_Customers / Total_Customers) * 100)

ggplot(churn_rate, aes(x = InvoiceMonth, y = Churn_Rate)) +
  geom_line(color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Monthly Customer Churn Rate",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Churn Rate (%)")

```

## Business Insights:

💡 **Understanding Churn Rate Trends:**

-   If **churn rate increases over time**, it indicates **declining customer retention**, requiring strategic intervention.

-   If **churn rate spikes in specific months**, it may be due to **seasonal trends** (e.g., post-holiday drop in purchases).

-   **Reducing churn is more cost-effective than acquiring new customers**, making retention strategies crucial.

✅ **Business Strategies:**

-   **Win-back campaigns:** Send special offers to customers who haven't purchased in the last 60-90 days.

-   **Customer segmentation-based offers:** Identify high-churn-risk customers and provide personalized discounts.

-   **Automated email marketing:** Trigger email reminders when a customer hasn’t made a purchase for a set period.

# **ROI Analysis of Clustering-Based Marketing**

This code calculates the **Return on Investment (ROI)** for different clustering-based marketing strategies by adjusting the **targeted customer percentage** and **campaign costs per customer**.

**Key Adjustments:**

-   **Targeting only 2%** of total customers instead of 10%, ensuring a **more focused** marketing approach.

-   **Increasing campaign cost per customer** to **\$50-\$60**, reflecting more realistic advertising expenses.

```{r}
roi_calculation <- function(conversion_rate, avg_spend, campaign_cost, total_customers) {
  new_revenue <- conversion_rate * avg_spend * total_customers
  roi <- ((new_revenue - campaign_cost) / campaign_cost) * 100
  return(roi)
}

total_customers_kmeans <- nrow(customer_rfm[customer_rfm$Cluster_KMeans == 1, ])
total_customers_dbscan <- nrow(customer_rfm[customer_rfm$Cluster_DBSCAN == 1, ])
total_customers_gmm <- nrow(customer_rfm[customer_rfm$Cluster_GMM == 1, ])


# Reduce marketing target customers (from 10% to 2%)
total_targeted_customers_kmeans <- total_customers_kmeans * 0.02
total_targeted_customers_dbscan <- total_customers_dbscan * 0.02
total_targeted_customers_gmm <- total_customers_gmm * 0.02

# Increase campaign cost (per customer $50-$60)
campaign_costs_kmeans <- total_targeted_customers_kmeans * 50
campaign_costs_dbscan <- total_targeted_customers_dbscan * 60
campaign_costs_gmm <- total_targeted_customers_gmm * 55

actual_avg_spend <- mean(customer_rfm$Monetary, na.rm = TRUE)

# 计算 ROI
roi_kmeans <- roi_calculation(0.1, actual_avg_spend, campaign_costs_kmeans, total_targeted_customers_kmeans)
roi_dbscan <- roi_calculation(0.15, actual_avg_spend, campaign_costs_dbscan, total_targeted_customers_dbscan)
roi_gmm <- roi_calculation(0.12, actual_avg_spend, campaign_costs_gmm, total_targeted_customers_gmm)

# 输出 ROI 结果
paste("Final Corrected ROI (K-Means):", round(roi_kmeans, 2), "%")
paste("Final Corrected ROI (DBSCAN):", round(roi_dbscan, 2), "%")
paste("Final Corrected ROI (GMM):", round(roi_gmm, 2), "%")


```

## **Interpretation of ROI Results**

-   **DBSCAN has the highest ROI (413.57%)**

    -   **Why?** DBSCAN identifies **high-density customer clusters**, meaning it **focuses on the most engaged and valuable customers**.

    -   **Business Insight:** This suggests that **targeting customers in DBSCAN clusters yields the best returns**, as these customers **convert more often and spend more**.

    -   **Marketing Strategy:**

        -   Personalized **loyalty rewards** for these high-value customers.

        -   **Exclusive membership perks** to encourage repeat purchases.

-   **GMM has a strong ROI (348.2%)**

    -   **Why?** GMM allows for **probabilistic customer segmentation**, meaning customers are **assigned weights based on multiple purchasing behaviors**.

    -   **Business Insight:** This means **GMM works well for identifying customers who may convert at a slightly lower but still profitable rate**.

    -   **Marketing Strategy:**

        -   **Predictive pricing models** to maximize profits from high-value segments.

        -   **Automated personalized recommendations** based on their likelihood to purchase.

-   **K-Means has the lowest (but still high) ROI (310.85%)**

    -   **Why?** K-Means provides **general customer groupings**, but may **misclassify certain high-value customers**.

    -   **Business Insight:** The ROI is still strong, indicating that K-Means works **well for large-scale campaigns** but may not be as precise as DBSCAN.

    -   **Marketing Strategy:**

        -   **Broad-based promotions** (e.g., seasonal sales, discount codes).

        -   **Email campaigns for re-engagement of medium-value customers**.

## Key Takeaways

✅ **DBSCAN is the best option for maximizing ROI**, ideal for **targeted high-value customer campaigns**.\

# Time-Series Analysis: Monthly Sales Trend

Understanding **sales trends** over time is essential for business planning.

```{r}
library(lubridate)

df_clean %>%
  mutate(InvoiceMonth = floor_date(InvoiceDate, "month")) %>%
  group_by(InvoiceMonth) %>%
  summarise(Total_Sales = sum(Total_Spend)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = InvoiceMonth, y = Total_Sales)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Monthly Sales Trend")

```

💡 **Insights**:

-   Sales **fluctuate seasonally**, peaking in **holiday months**.

-   A declining trend may indicate **customer churn**, requiring targeted marketing efforts.

# Time-Series Forecasting for Sales Prediction

Understanding historical sales trends is useful, but **predicting future sales** allows businesses to **optimize inventory, marketing budgets, and promotional strategies**. Here, we use the **ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)** model to forecast future sales.

## **Data Preprocessing**

Before running the forecasting model, we:

1.  **Aggregate transaction data on a monthly basis** by summing total sales.

2.  **Ensure chronological order** for accurate forecasting.

3.  **Convert data into a time-series object (TS)** for forecasting.

## **Applying ARIMA for Sales Forecasting**

ARIMA is a widely used model for **time-series forecasting**, combining:

-   **AutoRegressive (AR)**: Uses past values to predict future trends.

-   **Integrated (I)**: Differencing to make data stationary.

-   **Moving Average (MA)**: Accounts for past errors in predictions.

```{r}
library(forecast)

# Ensure InvoiceMonth is ordered correctly
sales_ts_data <- df_clean %>%
  mutate(InvoiceMonth = floor_date(InvoiceDate, "month")) %>%
  group_by(InvoiceMonth) %>%
  summarise(Total_Sales = sum(Total_Spend)) %>%
  arrange(InvoiceMonth)  # Ensures chronological order

# Convert to time-series object
sales_ts <- ts(sales_ts_data$Total_Sales, 
               start = c(year(min(sales_ts_data$InvoiceMonth)), month(min(sales_ts_data$InvoiceMonth))), 
               frequency = 12)  # 12 represents monthly data

# Fit ARIMA model
fit <- auto.arima(sales_ts)

# Forecast next 6 months
forecasted_sales <- forecast(fit, h = 6)

# Visualize the forecast
autoplot(forecasted_sales) + 
  labs(title = "6-Month Sales Forecast",
       x = "Month",
       y = "Total Sales")


```

## Business Insights:

💡 **Why is sales forecasting important?**

-   **Identify future revenue trends**: Determine if sales are expected to increase or decline.

-   **Optimize inventory planning**: If sales are expected to increase, ensure sufficient stock availability.

-   **Adjust marketing strategies**: If lower sales are forecasted for upcoming months, businesses can launch promotions to boost revenue.

✅ **Actionable Business Strategies:**

-   If **sales are forecasted to decline**, consider launching:

    -   **Promotional campaigns**: Limited-time discounts to stimulate demand.
